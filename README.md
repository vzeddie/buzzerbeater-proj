This script is from the archives written a while ago

This script was for my cousin who had an old `bbphp` site that had a bunch of people playing fantasy basketball. My cousin was one of the...leaders (? I don't even know) of the site so it fell to him to do some statistics. The site was horribly old so he wanted to get a list of players and their stats to do comparisons and show who won which games.
This script would call the few API calls the site had and populate a Google spreadsheet.
